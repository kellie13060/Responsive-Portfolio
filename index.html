            <p>Hi! I'm Kellie and this page is all about me and my journey through learning how to code!</p>
            <p>My favorite activity is to be outside in any way possible. I love backpacking, hiking, biking and
                camping. In the winter I love skiing and snowshoeing. I discovered though my life that I love teaching
                children. My career has consisted of working wtih children with autism and being a third grade teacher.
                While working in my current position I have discovered that I really like technology and have a natural
                knack for figuring it out. I have really enjoyed my previous profession, but I am very excited to be
                starting down a new path. I hope I can merge these two careers with two areas that I know well.</p>
